As you can see the textures for the iris and white of this eye were photoshoped composites of source images I took of my own eye.
Creating the character model into which the eye was inserted actually took vastly longer than the eyeball itself
(though the eye's photo-realism often impresses people more than the somewhat cartoonish character).
